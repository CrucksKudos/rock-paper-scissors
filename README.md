# Rock Paper Scissors - The Odin Project

This is a project from **The Odin Project** curriculum, where I created a console-based **Rock Paper Scissors** game. The goal was to practice **JavaScript** fundamentals, including functions, loops, conditionals, and user interaction.

## Project Overview

The game consists of a best-of-five series where the player competes against the computer. The player inputs their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer generates a random choice. The game determines the winner of each round based on the classic rules and announces the final result in the console.

## Features of the Game

- **Randomized Computer Choices**: Ensures fairness using `Math.random()`.
- **Player Input**: Captures the playerâ€™s choice via `prompt`.
- **Round-by-Round Results**: Displays the winner of each round in the console.
- **Best-of-Five Format**: Declares the final winner after five rounds.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Game logic and functionality.
- **HTML**: Simple structure to link the JavaScript file.
- **Browser Console**: For user interaction and displaying results.
